    ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
    The Professional README Generator project aims to help a user generate a README file for a new project. This is extremely useful because when generally creating a README file, it is often tedious and time consuming. This project takes aim at lazy software developers that may not crreate a README file out of sheer laziness or etc. This will eliminate any excuse for NOT creating a README file. 
    I created this project to allow a user to answer pre-written questions, to create  an organizaed/professional README file. 
    After installing all things necessary, the user simply just has to follow and answer every question. Once all completed, the file will be created. Once created it can simply be copied and pasted to maximum time efficiency and professionalness. 
    ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
    Download the file below. It should be in the form of a 'zip' file. Copy it to a directory on whichever local device or platform being used. For this project we used vsCode. Then once your in vsCode, ensure you're in the correct directory. Then you'll be ready to run the app. 
    ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
    To use, open whichever code editor you use, specify in its terminal the specific root folder for this project. Then next you would run the actual project, in this case it would be'node index'. There is no need to include the .js at the end of 'index' because it is assumed when first typing node, that the following file is a JavaScript file. Then the finished file will be found in the 'utils' folder with the name 'professionally-generated-README.md'

    ## [Tests](#table-of-contents)
    To test, open whichever code editor you use, specify in its terminal the specific root folder for this project. Then next you would run in the terminal 'node index' which would begin the prompt of questions for the user.
